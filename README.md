Welcome to the London Housing Supply Analysis Project! This project aims to investigate the impact of economic and social factors on the supply of houses in London. By examining the relationship between population, number of jobs, interest rates, life satisfaction, and mean salary, we aim to provide valuable insights for policy makers, real estate professionals, and researchers interested in the London housing market.

## Project Overview
The London Housing Supply Analysis Project combines data from various sources to explore the influence of economic and social factors on the supply of houses in London. Our dataset spans a 20-year period from 2000 to 2019, allowing us to identify both short-term and long-term trends. With this comprehensive analysis, we seek to better understand the underlying forces shaping the housing market and provide valuable recommendations for addressing current challenges.
